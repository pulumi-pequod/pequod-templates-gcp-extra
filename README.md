# pequod-templates-gcp-extra
Repo for Google cloud focused templates that are not always connected to Pequod. 
This keeps the Templates page cleaner for demos.

## Usage
* Feel free to add the repo to the Organization Template Sources on Pequod's Integrations view.
* When done, check to see if anyone is using any of the templates from this source.
* If not, then remove the template from Pequod's Integrations view.
* If so, then presumably that person will remove the source after they are done.
